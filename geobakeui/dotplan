Nordamerikas regioner Ã¤r tomma, men border vertices verkar finnas...


// FIXME: very drawcall-heavy. Can be done in one drawcall with fatter vertices.
// Possible to draw each region with barycenter and national colors in vertex buffer.
// Can run vertex transforms from that barycenter and a progression in uniforms

// Rendering overview:
/*
Regions outlines are single drawcalls, ~250 of them. Possible to pack all border
vertices into one buffer and run _LINES instead of _LINE_LOOP. That would roughly
double the index count, but save almost a frame's worth of draw call.

Region fills could also be crushed into 1+1 drawcalls (separate handling of interacted
region.

That would get us down from ~500 drawcalls to ~5. At that point, it might actually be
viable to run with the full 250ktri dataset, or at least close to it. It leaves plenty
of space for POI markers and better shading, especially with aabb culling.
