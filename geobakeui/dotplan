# Road to Final

## POI rendering
- progressive POI plane rendering
- alpha based on distance to POI type
- sprite sheet support

## Labels
- composite UIView over GLKView
- what framerate at full dataset?
-

## Region rendering
- barycentrics to render edges
- the below reasoning is invalid (must do straight drawarrays, but that is fine I believe)
-- should be possible to color every tri in the tessellation
   to express edges. Every exterior edge should be able to
   interpolate from 0 to 0 along one barycentric dimension.
-- three exterior edges: (1 0 0)-(0 1 0)-(0 0 1)
-- two exterior edges:   (1 0 0)-(1 0 0)-(0 1 0)
-- one exterior edge: 	 (1 0 0)-(1 1 0)-(0 1 1)
-- Ah, not as simple: two consecutive exterior edges might belong to the
   same triangle, and the third vertex must then be different from both.
   That fixates the coordinate of the third vertex, but that third vertex
   might be shared by another similar triangle that has different dimensions
   on the outer border.
- generate UVs to control coordinate traversal
- generate shard overlay



## User journey
### Insights
- need a selection state separate from opening
-- which means "visited" and "opened" are two different states
- cities are used to navigate, especially at detailed levels
-- which means cities must be visible on any closed region

### First boot
U launches tapmap and is met by an overview of the world.
There is only land and sea. U taps the landmass. The borders around
the continents highlight, and the name "Earth" is displayed.
Also, a small circle appears, an inviting tap-to-select.
Tapping there, U marks Earth as visited.
?? How does the difference between selection and opening look?
U long-presses the landmass, and the cracks quickly spread out around U's finger.

When the cracks have spread to the edges of the landmass, it fractures
and reveals the continents underneath. The capitals of the world are marked
by little stars.

U has been to Europe, and taps it to mark it as visited.
U then long-presses Europe.
Europe splits apart to reveal the countries underneath.
The countries are labeled and tinted in their national
colours so they can be easily found.

At this point, U expects to be able to mark countries U has visited.
However, every opened country splits apart into their constituent regions.

The world fractures into a beautiful jagged mess of regions and
provinces, with names few have noticed. Gone is the "went to Germany",
and instead U went to Bavaria, Th√ºringen and Brandenburg.

### Covering U's travel history
U now starts going over past journeys. U keeps going through
Europe, drilling into countries. U leaves some of them marked
as visited but will come back later to sort out the provinces.

U makes a simple mistake by tapping Switzerland instead of Austria.
By tapping again, Switzerland is no longer marked as visited.
Had U also opened Switzerland, a simple pinch would have closed
Switzerland again, and closed all its cantons too.

Soon U reaches the less familiar region level. U is not sure whether the
visit to Bangkok means Samut Prakan or Samut Sakhon. By zooming in a bit,
cities are named by labels. U finds the Bangkok Metropolis area, and presses
the circle to mark it as visited.

### Making something from the data
U has marked and opened the parts of the world U has visited.
There is a button on the map, that flips it around to the backside.
On the backside is a wealth of presentation modes
