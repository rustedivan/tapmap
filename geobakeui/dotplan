# Road to Final

## POI rendering
- progressive POI plane rendering
- alpha based on distance to POI type
- sprite sheet support

## Labels
- composite UIView over GLKView
- what framerate at full dataset?
-

## Region rendering
- barycentrics to render edges
- generate UVs to control coordinate traversal
- generate shard overlay



## User journey
### Insights
- need a selection state separate from opening
-- which means "visited" and "opened" are two different states
- cities are used to navigate, especially at detailed levels
-- which means cities must be visible on any closed region

### First boot
U launches tapmap and is met by an overview of the world.
There is only land and sea. U taps the landmass. The borders around
the continents highlight, and the name "Earth" is displayed.
Also, a small circle appears, an inviting tap-to-select.
Tapping there, U marks Earth as visited.
U long-presses the landmass, and the cracks quickly spread out around U's finger.

When the cracks have spread to the edges of the landmass, it fractures
and reveals the continents underneath. The capitals of the world are marked
by little stars.

U has been to Europe, and taps it to mark it as visited.
U then long-presses Europe.
Europe splits apart to reveal the countries underneath.
The countries are labeled and tinted in their national
colours so they can be easily found.

At this point, U expects to be able to mark countries U has visited.
However, every opened country splits apart into their constituent regions.

The world fractures into a beautiful jagged mess of regions and
provinces, with names few have noticed. Gone is the "went to Thailand",
and instead U went to Nayok, Si Thammarat, Surat Thani and Ranong.

### Covering history
U now starts going over past journeys. U keeps going through
Europe, drilling into countries. U leaves some of them marked
as visited but will come back later to sort out the provinces.

U makes a simple mistake by tapping Switzerland instead of Austria.
By tapping again, Switzerland is no longer marked as visited.
Had U also opened Switzerland, a simple pinch would have closed
Switzerland again, and closed all its cantons too.

Soon U reaches less familiar regions. U is not sure whether the
visit to Munich means Bavaria or Th√ºringen. By zooming in a bit,
cities are named by labels.
